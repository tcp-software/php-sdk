ShiftPlanning PHP SDK
================

The [ShiftPlanning API](http://www.shiftplanning.com/api/) allows you to call modules within the ShiftPlanning service that respond in REST style JSON & XML.

This repository contains the open source PHP SDK that allows you to utilize the
above on your website. Except as otherwise noted, the ShiftPlanning PHP SDK
is licensed under the Apache Licence, Version 2.0
(http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)


Usage
-----

The [examples][examples] are a good place to start. The minimal you'll need to
have is:

    <?php

    require './shiftplanning.php';

	$shiftplanning = new shiftplanning(
		array(
			'key' => 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' // enter your developer key
		)
	);

To make [API][API] calls:

	$response = $shiftplanning->setRequest(
		array(
			'module' => 'schedule.shifts',
			'start_date' => 'today',
			'start_date' => 'today',
			'mode' => 'overview'
		)
	);

Logged in vs Logged out:

    if ($session = $shiftplanning->getSession( );) {
		// LOGGED IN
    } else {
		// LOGGED OUT
    }

Tests
-----

In order to keep us nimble and allow us to bring you new functionality, without
compromising on stability, we have ensured full test coverage of the new SDK.
We are including this in the open source repository to assure you of our
commitment to quality, but also with the hopes that you will contribute back to
help keep it stable. The easiest way to do so is to file bugs and include a
test case.
